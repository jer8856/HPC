Distributed Image Processing using MPI

This implementation reads a .txt file which have the paths of the images to process.
The code is written for Gaussian filter bluring, the code uses a variable r which is the
radious of the filter, while higher r is higher is the factor of bluring.

compile: make 
usage: mpirun -np <#cores> dip.x <r> <file with name of images>
       mpirun -np 4 dip.x 0.5 imgs.txt
